Comes with a user-friendly interface
Is Avast Free a good antivirus?
Avast Free Antivirus is one of the few antivirus tools that offer enhanced security without putting a price tag on its services. The free program provides real-time protection that keeps a check on downloaded files, emails, P2P transfers, instant messages, online browsing, and more. Once installed, the free antivirus software can also scan and detect malicious browser plugins.

Scans your network
Apart from scanning your entire PC to provide robust protection, the Avast Free Antivirus download also scans your home or Wi-Fi network for potential threats. Once launched, the tool scans the network to identify vulnerabilities that could compromise your private data or sensitive information. It also scans emails, messages, and files arriving via the network to protect your computer from cyber threats and attacks.

Offers real-time scanning
With the help of real-time scanning, you can rest knowing Avast Free Antivirus will continue working even when you don’t. This is because it comes with an in-built behavior scanner called the Behavior Shield that keeps track of all programs and tools to detect any behavioral changes. These could be signs that alert the free antivirus software to attempts being made by a virus to manipulate or modify PC apps.

Does Avast remove viruses?
Yes, the free antivirus program is capable of detecting as well as removing all viruses that it finds on your computer. Moreover, the company that designed the tool states that the software won’t just detect and delete malware, but will also stop it from infecting your system again. It also offers real-time threat protection by scanning your network, files, and browsers for any threats.

How long does Avast free antivirus last?
The free anti-malware tool doesn’t come with a yearly subscription model that you may need to pay for after a year. Instead, the program makes all its basic features available for free to its users. That said, it does offer a few premium plans that come with advanced security measures as well as additional features. The premium plans are quite reasonable and last for a year before asking you to pay for updates.

AI-enhanced defense against scams and threats
Avast Free Antivirus now has built-in Anti-scam features as part of Scam Guardian, which help protect you from online scams like phishing and fake messages. Whether it’s a suspicious email, a sketchy text message, or a dangerous link on a website, this AI-powered scam protection is designed to spot the warning signs and keep you safe. As scams get more personal and harder to recognize, this feature adds an extra layer of protection to help you avoid being tricked.

The Avast Scam Guardian feature is powered by two key components that protect users from real-time scams: Avast Assistant and Web Guard. Avast Assistant is an AI-powered on-screen assistant that helps you stay protected if you think you're being scammed. Ask it a question or upload a copy of a suspicious offer, email, SMS, or other message, and it will provide context-aware warnings, guidance, and more. Meanwhile, the Web Guard functionality is the behind-the-scenes engine that identifies hidden scams and blocks access to malicious websites. It’s always on, checking each URL you visit for signs of fraud, phishing, scam activity, and using a 24/7 AI-powered threat detection.

Network Security in Avast combines Network Inspector and Firewall to help you connect to the internet confidently. It instantly checks if your Wi-Fi is secure, monitors for intruders, and easily adjusts app permissions. With Hack Alerts, you’ll also be notified if any passwords linked to your email have been leaked, keeping your identity safe. However, the free version regularly shows upgrade prompts and promotional pop-ups, which can be intrusive.

Should I download Avast Free Antivirus?
If you’re looking for a simple and easy-to-use free antivirus tool, you should download Avast Free Antivirus. As the name suggests, the program is free to use and comes with a range of features that help detect and delete viruses, spyware, ransomware, and malware. It also keeps a constant check on the apps installed on your PC to highlight any new or malicious behavior.

Additionally, the program can also scan your network to detect any threats and identify vulnerable points. The latter could be anything from weak passwords to default settings. Once threats are detected and removed, Avast prevents them from infecting your PC again. The software also searches for threats on your email, files, P2P transfers, and instant texts, to ensure your overall security.
